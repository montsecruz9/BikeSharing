# BikeSharing 

## Overview of the project
The purpose of this analysis is to figure out how the Bike Sharing business works in NYC, to have an idea how this kind of business may work in Des Moines, Iowa. A Tableau Story will be created in order to show potential investors our findings.

## Results
### General Information

Here we have a first glance of the BikeCiti business in the month of August in NYC. There's a total number of rides of 2,344,224. Customers are mostly men. Lastly, the third graph shows that the business has more subscribers than customers. 

### August Peak Hours

As August is the perfect month to visit NYC, analyzing the peak hours of the business in this month will help us determine the number of bikes we might need in Des Moines. At 5PM, there was a total of 224,566 bike trips. From 12-5AM there's the least number of bike trips recorded. During this time it might be a great idea to do some maintenance to those bikes in need of it. 

### Top Starting Locations

The highest traffic locations for starting and ending a journey are those with touristic spots. 

### Checkout Times for Users

This graph tells us that most trips last for 5 minutes. Just a few number of users will use the bikes for 1 hour, and even less users will use the bike for 2 hours or more. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

We use this graph to break it down a little more. We are getting the length of time that bikes are checked out by gender. So, the highest number of trips (108,087 trips) taken by male users lasted 5 minutes. The highest number of trips (34,151 trips) taken by female users lasted 6 minutes. And, the highest number of trips (7,389 trips) taken by 'unknown' users lasted 11 minutes. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Peak hours during the weekdays are from 6-9AM and from 5-7PM. Users use their bikes for commuting. On the other hand, during the weekend, users use the bikes late in the morning and almost the whole afternoon, from 10AM-7PM. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Again, male users have the highest count of bike trips overall. Male and female users will use the bikes for commuting during the weekdays and for spending a nice weekend sightseeing/touristing around the city.  

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

The type of users using the bikes more during the weekends are customers. Those using the bikes during the weekdays are subscribers.

## Summary

After analyzing the NYC Citi Bike Sharing business in NYC, we now have an idea of how to make this business work in Des Moines, Iowa. The type of customers to expect are mostly male users. There'll be a higher number of subscribers than customers. Subscribers are the ones that will use the bikes for commuting during the weekdays and customers use the bikes for the weekends, while strolling around the city. We then know that the highest traffic locations will be those in the Des Moines city center, probably near the Civic Center Historic District, as it is both a touristic and business area. Two other visualizations might be of use for future analysis:
- A map of the city showing the highest traffic locations (size) by type of users (color). This will help us determine what kind of users, customer or subscriber, we can expect to move around the hot spots from the city. 
- A line graph showing the age of users separated by user type. Are subscribers older than customers? Usually, an adult would be the one to pay for a subscription, but maybe a younger person might use the bikes more often, so I think it would be interesting to analyze a visualization like this one.
